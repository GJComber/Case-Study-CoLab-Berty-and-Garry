The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is a market leader in the area of total market capitalisation,  the Australian market in profitability, customer service and digital offerings. However, it has spectacularly failed when it has come to managing regulatory and reputational risk. In the past year, CBA faced an AUD 700 million (USD 500 million) settlement for 53,750 breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act, as well as a sarcastic report from the banking regulator on its risk and regulatory practices, the early resignation of its CEO and the scrutiny of a Royal Commission.
In the last decades, the explosion of the volume of digital document images and the development of consumer tools to forge these images has led to a huge increase in the number of corrupted documents in the financial sector. The development of many tools and methods to detect modifications has also increased but benchmarking remains a challenge. With all the benefits it comes with, development of technologies has also an important side effect. For instance, number of amateur fraudsters has increased. Actually, it is quite accessible for many people to scan any loan contractual documents (payslip, bill, mortgage deeds etc.), modify one or several critical field (name, date, amount of money, etc.) and print it with common devices and basic software’s (MS Paint, Gimp, etc.).

In recent years, fraud has been a significant issue in the banking, medical, insurance, and IT sectors. In the banking industry there has been an increase in online transactions through submitting required loan application documents such as payment slips, credit rating details, project reports, loan collaterals and etc. Similar risk of fraudulent activities increases in the fields of different payment options such as credit/debit cards, PhonePe, Gpay, Paytm, etc. Moreover, fraudsters have become proficient in finding loopholes that they then misuse. Hence it has become a challenging task to make a secure system for authentication and preventing fraud. This is where fraud detection algorithms powered by machine learning prove helpful.

When customers apply for larger loans and mortgages, they usually have to supply supporting documents to prove that they hold the sufficient wealth (assets) and receive the respective income they claim. The financial institution must verify that these documents are legitimate as one of the steps in granting the loan request. Machine learning and artificial intelligence tools can help the bank's fraud detection team focus on the most likely fraudulent documents - it would be impossible to examine them all thoroughly. These tools can also be adapted as the methods of the fraudsters change over time.

## Why CBA considered a fintech company?
- Minimise frauds in the field of digital and online payment mechanism (credit/debit cards, PhonePe, Gpay, Paytm, etc), contractual loan documentation (payslip, bill, mortgage deeds, guarantor’s details documents etc.), Money Laundering and Terrorism funding, Phishing.

## Why is CBA exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

CBA investment in technology including data, machine learning and artificial intelligence is giving us unique insights into each customer’s individual needs. Customers want more control over their financial affairs, more confidence they can achieve financial goals, and an ability to manage all of their financial life in one place.

## What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
Banking in 2030 CBA will become a trusted interface for life, embedded within the needs and lifestyles of consumers Delivery and experience re-defined by 2030 Data will underpin the delivery of seamless, integrated experiences that span beyond banking to anticipate and satisfy other customer needs. Data will be at the heart of how banks deliver new forms of value to customers and how they will make money in 2030 (in response to emerging consumer needs around their personal data). Setting banking within the consumers everyday needs, lifestyles and life-stages will be key - as will providing and creating financial services (and other services) to meet the immediate satisfaction of these demands.

## Everything and everyone will be connected
By 2030 a hyper-connected world will be the norm. Consumers will be interacting with their service providers through voice and personal assistants, facial recognition and wearable devices. Every engagement point of our lives will become a service. CBA of the Future proactively switching your subscriptions with non-banking services because they found a better offer available than your current provider. This could include the management of utilities and services in your home. With usage patterns well known through smart meters, banks can analyse providers’ offers based on peak pricing and volume discounts, switching providers in the background as better deals become available. Conversely, entities from other sectors will also be trying to offer their customers the ability to optimise financial services.

## The rise of AI
Algorithms and data models will be built around optimising financial outcomes for customers and will frequently strengthen positive behaviours through ‘nudging’ individuals to do certain things. For example, supporting sectors of the population that are time poor and are seeking greater convenience, as well as preventing susceptible customers from making poor financial decisions. These nudges will be universal, and not restricted to certain segments of customers.

## Distributed Trust
The CBA of the Future will be able to lead the redefinition and pashion of trust, leveraging their heritage and experience to gain a distinct advantage over newer entrants. Through the delivery of services enabled by digital identity and DLT - customers can trust that the automation and decisions made on their behalf are noticeable, reconcilable and crystal clear to them. This will help consumers manage their increasingly complex and fragmented lives.

## The ‘super-app’
The quest to create a ‘super-app’ or virtual service that can combine digital confidence, privacy, access control and can enable products and services has significant implications, as it allows successful entities to keep customers within their ecosystems for nearly all their activities, and away from their competitors.

## Payments
Intelligent payment financing facilities that dynamically assign rates, and extend context relevant credit linked to the transaction type and spend are presented to consumers as an extension of buy now, pay later services. Customers’ credit assessments will be far more holistic and will update in real-time, taking inputs such as lifestyle habits, purchase history and predictive analytics. Credit products will be far more tailored to an individual, providing customers with flexible repayment plans for each transaction while integrating rewards programs based on their credit rating. Transaction experiences will not differ between transferring between friends, or between continents. The biggest change is in the global B2C commerce space as consumers will be free to spend overseas with international merchants without incurring foreign exchange fees.

## AI-driven cyber security
By 2030, CBA cyber security will be built around enterprise-wide predictive analytics, security susceptibility and threat recognition, all powered by AI. Imagine AI redefining the assessment of online security vulnerabilities as it identifies and remediates security issues in real-time, preventing hackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.

## Digital currencies
The rise of digital currencies (and tokens) that will be issued by central banks and corporate players will further accelerate the transformation of products and services. This digitisation of money will bring greater financial inclusion overall, broader transparency and better real-time transaction processing and settlement.
