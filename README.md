The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is a market leader in the area of total market capitalisation,  the Australian market in profitability, customer service and digital offerings. However, it has spectacularly failed when it has come to managing regulatory and reputational risk. In the past year, CBA faced an AUD 700 million (USD 500 million) settlement for 53,750 breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act, as well as a sarcastic report from the banking regulator on its risk and regulatory practices, the early resignation of its CEO and the scrutiny of a Royal Commission.
In the last decades, the explosion of the volume of digital document images and the development of consumer tools to forge these images has led to a huge increase in the number of corrupted documents in the financial sector. The development of many tools and methods to detect modifications has also increased but benchmarking remains a challenge. With all the benefits it comes with, development of technologies has also an important side effect. For instance, number of amateur fraudsters has increased. Actually, it is quite accessible for many people to scan any loan contractual documents (payslip, bill, mortgage deeds etc.), modify one or several critical field (name, date, amount of money, etc.) and print it with common devices and basic software’s (MS Paint, Gimp, etc.).

In recent years, fraud has been a significant issue in the banking, medical, insurance, and IT sectors. In the banking industry there has been an increase in online transactions through submitting required loan application documents such as payment slips, credit rating details, project reports, loan collaterals and etc. Similar risk of fraudulent activities increases in the fields of different payment options such as credit/debit cards, PhonePe, Gpay, Paytm, etc. Moreover, fraudsters have become proficient in finding loopholes that they then misuse. Hence it has become a challenging task to make a secure system for authentication and preventing fraud. This is where fraud detection algorithms powered by machine learning prove helpful.

When customers apply for larger loans and mortgages, they usually have to supply supporting documents to prove that they hold the sufficient wealth (assets) and receive the respective income they claim. The financial institution must verify that these documents are legitimate as one of the steps in granting the loan request. Machine learning and artificial intelligence tools can help the bank's fraud detection team focus on the most likely fraudulent documents - it would be impossible to examine them all thoroughly. These tools can also be adapted as the methods of the fraudsters change over time.

## Why CBA considered a fintech company?
- Minimise frauds in the field of digital and online payment mechanism (credit/debit cards, PhonePe, Gpay, Paytm, etc), contractual loan documentation (payslip, bill, mortgage deeds, guarantor’s details documents etc.), Money Laundering and Terrorism funding, Phishing.
- Fintech companies provide the banks with access to new capabilities (e.g. products, experience design, processes, systems,  people), in order to better serve customer needs.
- Fintech companies offer the banks a faster speed to market than in-house development provides
- They come with lower costs and investments, as transformation of legacy businesses isn’t required, and
- They reduce project delivery risks, given that they plug into existing businesses.
- Finally, Fintech company caused to maximise the overall of wealth to its stakeholders and economic wellbeing of the entire society. 

## Why is CBA exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
Commonwealth Bank Chief Executive Officer, Matt Comyn, today announced that the Bank is accelerating its digital strategy with a motivation to provide customers with one of the best digital experiences of any company globally.Speaking at CBA’s 2021 technology briefing at the Bank’s new tech hub at South Eveleigh in Sydney today, Mr Comyn said: “CBA wants to remain Australia’s clear leader in digital banking. We recognise customers are no longer just benchmarking us against other financial institutions. They compare us with the best digital experiences they get from any business in the world. We intend to be at the global forefront of the digital experience, and be the trusted partner at the centre of our customers’ financial lives. 

CBA investment in technology including data, machine learning and artificial intelligence is giving us unique insights into each customer’s individual needs. Customers want more control over their financial affairs, more confidence they can achieve financial goals, and an ability to manage all of their financial life in one place. Today bank also announced that CBA has applied for accreditation to ingest data under the government’s Open Banking regime.
